# CS50 Pset Sentimental: Pset1 to Pset3

> Sentimental record for my experience in CS50x from 2016 to 2018.

> Part of CS50's Pset 6 (Sentimental). Implemented previous Psets in Python to practice Python's syntax.

> (Couldn't find the files for previous Pset solutions I had implemented in C, so saving these Python files instead for recollection)

## Pset1: hello, mario, credit
> Initially solved hello, mario(less comfortable), credit(less comfortable) in C language in January, 2016.
> Solved in Python in June, 2018.
- hello: a simple program printing "hello" on screen.
>> first program in C, getting to know how to compile(using the make utility configured by CS50) and execute a .c file.
- mario: a program that prints out a full-pyramid of a specified height given by user.
>> learned how to use conditions and loops, got familiar with using I/O (using CS50's training wheels: get_int())

> Solved in Python in June, 2018.
- hello:

## Pset3: fifteen
> Initially, Pset3 was to implement a game of fifteen in 2016.
> Unfortunately, cannot find source code I implemented.
