# CS50 Pset Sentimental: Pset1 to Pset3

> Sentimental record for my experience in CS50x from 2016 to 2018.

> Part of CS50's Pset 6 (Sentimental). Implemented previous Psets in Python to practice Python's syntax.

> (Couldn't find the files for previous Pset solutions I had implemented in C, so saving these Python files instead for recollection)

## Pset1: hello, mario, credit
> Initially solved hello, mario(less comfortable version), cash(the less comfortable version) in C language in January, 2016.

> Solved hello, mario(more comfortable version), cash(the more comfortable version) in Python language in June, 2018.

- hello: a simple program printing "hello" on the screen.
  > first program in C, getting to know how to compile(using the make utility configured by CS50) and execute a .c file.
  
- mario: a program that prints out a full-pyramid of a specified height given by user.
         (the less comfortable version was to print out a half-pyramid)
  > learned how to use conditions and loops
  > helped get familiar with using standard I/O (using CS50's training wheels: get_int()).
  
- credit: a program that determines whether a provided credit card number is valid according to Luhnâ€™s algorithm (If valid, print the which company it belongs to:American Express, MasterCard, or Visa).
  > learned how to use various math functions and operators to interact with numeral values.
  --the less comfortable version was to implement cash.c which was a program that calculates the minimum number of coins required to give a user change)
  > learned how to implement a greedy algorithm and know how to handle the inherent imprecision of floating-point values

## Pset2: crack
> Initially, solved

> Solved in Python in June, 2018.

- crack: 


## Pset3: fifteen
> Initially, Pset3 was to implement a game of fifteen in 2016.

> Unfortunately, could not find source code I implemented.
