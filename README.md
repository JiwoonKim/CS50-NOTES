# CS50 Psets: General Programming ( from Pset1 to Pset5 )

> Sentimental record for my experience in CS50x from 2016 to 2018.

> Problem Sets (Psets) from 1 to 6:Sentimentals.

> Couldn't find the files for previous Pset solutions (the less comfortable versions from pset1 to pset3) I had implemented in C, so saving the solutions for the more comfortable versions implemented in Python for pset6 sentimentals part.


## Pset1: hello, mario, cash, credit
> Initially solved hello, mario(less comfortable version), cash(the less comfortable version) in C language in January, 2016.

> Solved hello, mario(more comfortable version), cash(the more comfortable version) in Python language in June, 2018.

- hello: a simple program printing "hello" on the screen.
  > first program in C, getting to know how to compile(using the make utility configured by CS50) and execute a .c file.
  
- mario: a program that prints out a full-pyramid of a specified height given by user.
    - the less comfortable version: print out a half-pyramid.
  > learned how to use conditions and loops
  > helped get familiar with using standard I/O (using CS50's training wheels: get_int()).
  
- credit: a program that determines whether a provided credit card number is valid according to Luhn’s algorithm (If valid, print the which company it belongs to:American Express, MasterCard, or Visa).
  > learned how to use various math functions and operators to interact with numeral values.
  
    - the less comfortable version - cash: a program that calculates the minimum number of coins required to give a user change.
    
      > learned how to implement a greedy algorithm and how to handle the inherent imprecision of floating-point values.

## Pset2: caesar, vigenère, crack
> Initially, solved caesar(the less comfortable version), vigeniere(the less comfortable version) in C language in January, 2016.

> Solved crack(the more comfortable version) in Python in June, 2018.

- crack: a program that cracks passwords.
    - the less comfortable version - caesar: a program that encrypts messages using Caesar’s cipher.
    - the less comfortable version - vigenère: a program that encrypts messages using Vigenère’s cipher.
    
  > learned about encryption and decryption, ASCII values, how to use command-line arguments in programs, manipulate strings, and convert chars to integers.
      
## Pset3: fifteen
> Initially, Pset3 was to implement a game of fifteen in 2016.

> Unfortunately, could not find source code I implemented.


## Pset4: 
> Initially solved hello, mario(less comfortable version), cash(the less comfortable version) in C language in January, 2016.

> Solved hello, mario(more comfortable version), cash(the more comfortable version) in Python language in June, 2018.

- hello: a simple program printing "hello" on the screen.
  > first program in C, getting to know how to compile(using the make utility configured by CS50) and execute a .c file.
  
- mario: a program that prints out a full-pyramid of a specified height given by user.
    - the less comfortable version: print out a half-pyramid.
